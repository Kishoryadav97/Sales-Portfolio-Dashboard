Sales Portfolio Dashboard
üìå Problem Statement
In a growing business environment, executives and sales leaders at XYZ Traders need centralized, real-time visibility into key sales metrics to support informed decision-making. However, fragmented reporting and disjointed visuals hinder their ability to access data efficiently. As a Power BI Developer, the challenge was to design an interactive, easy-to-consume dashboard hosted on Power BI Service that consolidates critical sales performance indicators into a single view.

This assignment addresses the need for a custom Power BI dashboard that aligns business KPIs with intuitive, visual storytelling for fast-paced decision-making.

üìä Project Description: Sales Portfolio Dashboard - [Your Name]
The Sales Portfolio Dashboard was created in Power BI Service using a pre-published report (Sales Report.pbix). The goal was to highlight business-critical sales data such as total revenue, quantity sold, category breakdowns, year-on-year comparisons, and customer segmentation.
